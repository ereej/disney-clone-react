# Website Cloning Project 💫

This repository is for Disney website cloning project created as part of my React learning journey. The purpose of this project is to practice building user interfaces, managing states, and implementing Front-end functionalities using React.

## About the Project

This project involves recreating the design and basic functionality of the existing Disney website using React with Typescript and Firebase. The goal is only to replicate the visual style and implement core features to better grasp the concept of React framework. 📚
I used Typescript

### Learning Objectives:
- Understand React components, props, and state management.
- Practice using hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.
- Implement React Router for navigation.
- Work with styled-components.

### Website Being Cloned: DisneyPlus Official website.

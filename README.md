### Learning Objectives:
- Understand React components, props, and state management.
- Practice using hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.
- Implement React Router for navigation (if applicable).
- Work with styled-components or CSS modules for styling.

### Website Being Cloned:
The cloned website is **[Insert Website Name Here]**.
